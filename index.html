                  As a kid, when asked, "What do you want to be when you grow up?," I went back and forth between a teacher and a pediatrician. 
                  In college, I decided against both of those but found the next best thing: speech-language pathology. 
                  It combined teaching kids with my interest in anatomy and physiology so it was perfect, right?
                  I thought so and I continued on to get my master's degree in the field. Upon graduation, I started working for a school district with both elementary and high school students. 
                  I settled into my career with every intention of staying in the MO public school system until I retired.

                  I worked as a speech-language pathologist in schools for 7 years. It was always challenging, but I made the most of it and never stopped learning. I thought that as I became more proficient in my job, things would get more manageable.
                  By year 7, that still wasn't really the case and I decided that I needed a change. The next step was figuring out what to do instead. That is where several organizations came in and shook up my life in the best possible way.

                  I came across Rung for Women through a Facebook ad, the one time I've been thankful for their creepy algorithm. They advertised themselves as an organization to help women transition to careers in high-demand fields and make more money.
                  I was accepted into the program in March of 2022 and I dove head-first into everything they had to offer. Through coaching, assessments, career classes, and lots of self-reflection, I established a more thorough understanding of myself - my skills, my values, my workplace needs. 
                  Not only did this help me gain more confidence in general, but it also helped me determine that a career in the tech field would fit well with my work style and skills.

               <h3>LaunchCode</h3>
               <p>
                  One of my first steps to a career in tech is to learn how to code. Enter LaunchCode, a nonprofit organization that provides free education and job opportunities in the tech field. 
                  Since January 2023, I have been learning full-stack web development, including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
                  As the class goes on, I will continue to learn other languages and frameworks for full-stack web development.

            <h2 class="center">"What now?!?"</h2>
            <section>
               <p>Good question. What happens after LaunchCode is still up in the air. The idea of working in the field of technology is still very new to me and I'm not sure exactly what job is right for me.
                  The parts of me that went into the field of speech pathology because I cared about communication and wanted to help people, to make a difference, haven't changed. I have a few ideas that combine
                  the old with the new, including software developer for communication apps, natural language processing engineer, and accessibility engineer. Until then, I'm continuing to learn each day and taking everything one step at a time.
